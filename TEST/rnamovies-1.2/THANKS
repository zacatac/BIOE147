rnamovies THANKS file

rnamovies has originally been written by Dirk Evers.
Many people have further contributed to RNA Movies by reporting problems, 
suggesting various improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is
a list of these people. Help me keep it complete and exempt of errors.

The author would like to thank Gerhard Steger and his colleagues at the
Institute for Physical Biology, Heinrich-Heine University Duesseldorf for
many stimulating discussions on structure formation and Marc Rachen for his
data on PSTVd. Marc Rehmsmeier of the DKFZ-Heidelberg provided me with the
minimal energy paths for L. collosoma.

Part of the source code (saving in different formats) was written by
Alexander Sczyrba (now Rockefeller University New York).

Christian Zybill encouraged Dirk to rewrite the parser for large input files
and to provide a Macintosh version.

The work presented here (mainly my time) was partially supported by the
German Ministry for Education and Sciences (BMBF), the Ministry of Science
of North Rhine Westphalia (MWF-NRW) and the German Research Council
Graduate Programme on structure formation (DFG-GK "Strukturbildungsprozesse").
